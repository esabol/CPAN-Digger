# The new CPAN Digger

* Find low-hanging fruit to fix in CPAN

## Steps

* Fetch the list of recently uploaded released
* Check if there is a link to VCS
* Check if there is a link to bug tracking system (Q: what if the VCS is GitHub but the bug tracking is RT?)

* If the source code is on GitHub check if .travis.yml exists
* Maybe: Check if Travis is indeed running on this project

* Check for other CI systems?
* Check for license meta field
